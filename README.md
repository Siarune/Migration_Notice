# Migration_Notice
## I have moved!
In light of my dedication to FOSS philosophy, I have moved all of my repositories to [Sourcehut](https://sr.ht)
You can now find me [here](https://sr.ht/~siarune/) and I will soon be making a more detailed article of *how* for everyone that may not have the time to invest in learning everything.
The Software Freedom Conservancy has a [very good article](https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/) outlining why one should, but it's not for everyone.
